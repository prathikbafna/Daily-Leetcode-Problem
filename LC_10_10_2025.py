3186. Maximum Total Damage With Spell Casting

Medium

A magician has various spells.

You are given an array power, where each element represents the damage of a spell. Multiple spells can have the same damage value.

It is a known fact that if a magician decides to cast a spell with a damage of power[i], they cannot cast any spell with a damage of power[i] - 2, power[i] - 1, power[i] + 1, or power[i] + 2.

Each spell can be cast only once.

Return the maximum possible total damage that a magician can cast.

 

Example 1:

Input: power = [1,1,3,4]

Output: 6

Explanation:

The maximum possible damage of 6 is produced by casting spells 0, 1, 3 with damage 1, 1, 4.

Example 2:

Input: power = [7,1,6,6]

Output: 13

Explanation:

The maximum possible damage of 13 is produced by casting spells 1, 2, 3 with damage 1, 6, 6.
